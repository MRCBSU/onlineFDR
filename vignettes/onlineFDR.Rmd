## What is `onlineFDR`?

Multiple hypothesis testing is a fundamental problem in statistical inference.
The failure to manage the multiple testing problem has been highlighted as one
of the elements contributing to the replicability crisis in science (Ioannidis
2015). Methodologies have been developed for a family of hypotheses to adjust
the significance levels to manage the multiple testing situation by controlling
error metrics such as the familywise error rate (FWER) or the false discovery
rate (FDR).  

Frequently, modern data analysis problems have a further complexity that the
hypothesis arrive sequentially in a stream.

This introduces the challenge that
at each step the investigator must decide whether to reject the current null
hypothesis without having access to the future p-values or the total number of
hypothesis to be tested, but does have knowledge of the historic decisions to
date. The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (Koscielny *et al.*, 2013),
provides a concrete example of such a scenario. Here the dataset is constantly
growing as new knockout mice lines are generated and phenotyping data uploaded
to a database. 

Javanmard and Montanari proposed two procedures, LOND and LORD, to control the
FDR in an online manner (Javanmard and Montanari (2015, 2018)), with the latter
extended by Ramdas *et al.* (2017). The LOND procedure sets the adjusted
significance thresholds  based on the number of discoveries made so far, while
LORD sets them according to the time of the most recent discovery. Ramdas
*et al.* (2018) then proposed the SAFFRON procedure, which provides an adaptive
method of online FDR control. They also proposed a variant of the
Alpha-investing algorithm of Foster and Stine (2008) that guarantees FDR
control, using SAFFRON's update rule.

Subsequently, Zrnic *et al.* (2018) proposed procedures to control the modified
FDR (mFDR) in the context of *asynchronous* testing, i.e. where each hypothesis
test can itself be a sequential process and the tests can overlap in time. They
presented asynchronous versions of the LOND, LORD and SAFFRON procedures for a
variety of trial settings. For both synchronous and asynchronous testing, Tian
& Ramdas (2019a) proposed the ADDIS algorithms which compensate for the loss
in power in the presence of conservative nulls by adaptively 'discarding' these
p-values.

Finally, Tian & Ramdas (2019b) proposed procedures that provide online control
of the FWER. One procedure, online fallback, gives a uniform improvement to the
naive Alpha-spending procedure (see below). The ADDIS-spending procedure
compensates for the power loss of these procedures by including both adapativity
in the fraction of null hypotheses and the conservativeness of nulls.

The onlineFDR package implements all these procedures and provides wrapper
functions to apply them to a historic or growing dataset. As a comparison, we
have also provided a function for implementation of the Alpha-spending
procedure, which is based on the Bonferroni procedure adapted to the online
scenario. This vignette explains the use of the package and demonstrates a
typical workflow.

## Quick Start

Here we show the steps to achieve online FDR control of a growing dataset. First
load a dataframe with the three columns: an identifier ('id'), date ('date')
and p-value ('pval'), and then call the wrapper function of interest. Note that date
should be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". In order for the results to be reproducible,
we also set a seed using the `set.seed` function.

```{r}
library(onlineFDR)
library(Rcpp)

sample.df <- data.frame(
    id = c('A15432', 'B90969', 'C18705', 'B49731', 'E99902',
        'C38292', 'A30619', 'D46627', 'E29198', 'A41418',
        'D51456', 'C88669', 'E03673', 'A63155', 'B66033'),
    date = as.Date(c(rep("2014-12-01",3),
                    rep("2015-09-21",5),
                    rep("2016-05-19",2),
                    "2016-11-12",
                    rep("2017-03-27",4))),
    pval = c(2.90e-14, 0.06743, 0.01514, 0.08174, 0.00171,
            3.61e-05, 0.79149, 0.27201, 0.28295, 7.59e-08,
            0.69274, 0.30443, 0.000487, 0.72342, 0.54757))

set.seed(1)
results <- LORD(sample.df)
results

```

### Input data

A dataset with three columns (an identifier ('id'), date ('date') and p-value
('pval')). All p-values generated should be passed to the function (and not
just the significant p-values).  An exception to this would be if you have
implemented an orthogonal filter to reduce the dataset size, such as discussed
in  (Burgon *et al.*, 2010).

Alternatively, just the vector of p-values can be passed to the function. In
this case, the p-values are treated as being ordered sequentially with no
batches.

### What happens to the input data
The function orders the information by date. If there are multiple p-values
with the same date (i.e. the same batch), the order of the p-values within each
batch is randomised by default. Generally, users should randomise unless they have an *a priori* 
belief that hypotheses should be ordered in such way such that the ones with smaller p-values are rejected
initially in the stream. In order for the randomisation of the p-values to be reproducible, 
it is necessary to set a seed (via the `set.seed` function) before calling the wrapper function.

### Understanding the output

For each hypothesis test, the functions calculate the adjusted significance
thresholds (`alphai`) at which the corresponding p-value would be declared
statistically significant.   

Also calculated is an indicator function of discoveries (`R`), where `R[i] = 1`
corresponds to hypothesis i being rejected, otherwise `R[i] = 0`.  

A dataframe is returned, reordered by batch, with the original data and the
newly calculated `alphai` and `R`. 

### Using onlineFDR as your dataset grows
For simplicity, as the dataset grows, the new larger dataset should be passed
to the wrapper function and the values recalculated as per the example. In
order for the randomisation of the data within the previous batches to remain
the same (and hence to allow for reproducibility of the results),
*the same seed should be used for all analyses*.

## API

### Synchronous FDR Control
* `LOND()`
implements the LOND procedure for online FDR control, where LOND stands for
(significance) Levels based On Number of Discoveries, as presented by Javanmard
and Montanari (2015). The procedure controls the FDR for independent or
positively dependent (PRDS) p-values, with an option `(dep = TRUE)` which
guarantees control for arbitrarily dependent p-values.

* `LORD()`
implements the LORD procedure for online FDR control, where LORD stands for
(significance) Levels based On Recent Discovery, as presented by Javanmard and
Montanari (2018), Ramdas *et al.* (2017) and Tian & Ramdas (2019). The
function provides different versions of the procedure valid for independent
p-values, see `vignette("theory")`. There is also a version ('dep') that
guarantees control for dependent p-values.

* `SAFFRON()`
implements the SAFFRON procedure for online FDR control, where SAFFRON stands
for Serial estimate of the Alpha Fraction that is Futilely Rationed On true Null
hypotheses, as presented by Ramdas *et al.* (2018). The procedure provides an
adaptive method of online FDR control.

* `Alpha_investing()`
Implements a variant of the Alpha-investing algorithm of Foster and Stine (2008)
that guarantees FDR control, as proposed by Ramdas et al. (2018). This procedure
uses a variant of SAFFRON's update rule. This procedure controls the FDR for
independent p-values.

* `ADDIS()`
implements the ADDIS algorithm for online FDR control, where ADDIS stands for
an ADaptive algorithm that DIScards conservative nulls, as presented by Tian
& Ramdas (2019). The algorithm compensates for the power loss of SAFFRON
with conservative nulls, by including both adapativity in the fraction of
null hypotheses (like SAFFRON) and the conservativeness of nulls (unlike
SAFFRON). This procedure controls the FDR for independent p-values.

### Asynchronous FDR Control
* `LONDstar()`
implements the LOND algorithm for asynchronous online testing, as presented 
by Zrnic *et al.* (2018). This controls the mFDR.

* `LORDstar()`
implements LORD algorithms for asynchronous online testing, as presented by
Zrnic *et al.* (2018). This controls the mFDR.

* `SAFFRONstar()`
implements the SAFFRON algorithm for asynchronous online testing, as
presented by Zrnic *et al.* (2018). This controls the mFDR.

### FWER Control
* `Alpha_spending()`
implements online FWER control using a Bonferroni-like test. Alpha-spending
provides strong FWER control for arbitrarily dependent p-values.

* `online_fallback()`
implements the online fallback algorithm for FWER control, as proposed by
Tian & Ramdas (2019b). Online fallback is a uniformly more powerful method than
Alpha-spending, as it saves the significance level of a previous rejection.
Online fallback strongly controls the FWER for arbitrarily dependent p-values.

* `ADDIS_spending()`
implements the ADDIS-spending algorithm for online FWER control, as proposed by
Tian & Ramdas (2019b). The algorithm compensates for the power loss of
Alpha-spending, by including both adaptivity in the fraction of null hypotheses
and the conservativeness of nulls. ADDIS-spending provides strong FWER control
for independent p-values. Tian & Ramdas (2019b) also presented a version for
handling local dependence.
