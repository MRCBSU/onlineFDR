\title{LOND: Online FDR control based on number of discoveries}
\usage{
LOND(
  d,
  alpha = 0.05,
  betai,
  dep = FALSE,
  random = TRUE,
  date.format = "\%Y-\%m-\%d",
  original = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{Either a vector of p-values, or a dataframe with three columns: an
identifier (`id'), date (`date') and p-value (`pval'). If no column of
dates is provided, then the p-values are treated as being ordered
sequentially with no batches.}

\item{alpha}{Overall significance level of the FDR procedure, the default is
0.05.}

\item{betai}{Optional vector of \eqn{\beta_i}. A default is provided as
proposed by Javanmard and Montanari (2018), equation 31.}

\item{dep}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, runs the modified LOND algorithm which
guarantees FDR control for \emph{dependent} p-values. Defaults to
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{random}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (the default), then the order of the
p-values in each batch (i.e. those that have exactly the same date) is
randomised.}

\item{date.format}{Optional string giving the format that is used for dates.}

\item{original}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, runs the original LOND algorithm 
of Javanmard and Montanari (2015), otherwise runs the modified algorithm 
of Zrnic et al. (2018). Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
\item{d.out}{ A dataframe with the original data \code{d} (which
will be reordered if there are batches and \code{random = TRUE}), the
LOND-adjusted significance thresholds \eqn{\alpha_i} and the indicator
function of discoveries \code{R}. Hypothesis \eqn{i} is rejected if the
\eqn{i}-th p-value is less than or equal to \eqn{\alpha_i}, in which case
\code{R[i] = 1}  (otherwise \code{R[i] = 0}).}

\description{
Implements the LOND algorithm for online FDR control, where LOND stands for
(significance) Levels based On Number of Discoveries, as presented by
Javanmard and Montanari (2015).
}
\details{
The function takes as its input either a vector of p-values, or a dataframe
with three columns: an identifier (`id'), date (`date') and p-value (`pval').
The case where p-values arrive in batches corresponds to multiple instances
of the same date. If no column of dates is provided, then the p-values are
treated as being ordered sequentially with no batches.

The LOND algorithm controls the FDR for independent p-values (see below for
the modification for dependent p-values). Given an overall significance level
\eqn{\alpha}, we choose a sequence of non-negative numbers \eqn{\beta_i} such
that they sum to \eqn{\alpha}. The values of the adjusted significance
thresholds \eqn{\alpha_i} are chosen as follows: \deqn{\alpha_i = (D(i-1) +
1)\beta_i} where \eqn{D(n)} denotes the number of discoveries in the first
\eqn{n} hypotheses.

A slightly modified version of LOND with thresholds \eqn{\alpha_i =
max(D(i-1), 1)\beta_i} provably controls the FDR under positive dependence
(PRDS condition), see Zrnic et al. (2018).

For arbitrarily dependent p-values, LOND controls the FDR if it is modified
with \eqn{\beta_i / H(i)} in place of \eqn{\beta_i}, where \eqn{H(j)} is the
i-th harmonic number.

Further details of the LOND algorithm can be found in Javanmard and Montanari
(2015).
