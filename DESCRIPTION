Description: This package allows users to control the false discovery rate for
  online hypothesis testing, where hypotheses arrive sequentially in a stream,
  as presented by Javanmard and Montanari (2015, 2018), Ramdas et al.
  (2017, 2018), Tian and Ramdas (2019) and Zrnic et al. (2018). In this
  framework, a null hypothesis is rejected based only on the previous decisions,
  as the future p-values and the number of hypotheses to be tested are unknown.
