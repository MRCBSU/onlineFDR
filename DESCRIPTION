Description: This package allows users to control the false discovery rate for
  online hypothesis testing, where hypotheses arrive sequentially in a stream,
  as presented by Javanmard and Montanari (2015, 2018) and Ramdas et al.
  (2017, 2018). In this framework, a null hypothesis is rejected based only on
  the previous decisions, as the future p-values and the number of hypotheses
  to be tested are unknown.
