Description: This package allows users to control the false discovery rate (FDR)
  or familywise error rate (FWER) for online hypothesis testing, where
  hypotheses arrive sequentially in a stream. In this framework, a null
  hypothesis is rejected based only on the previous decisions, as the future
  p-values and the number of hypotheses to be tested are unknown.
