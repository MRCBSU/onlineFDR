Description: This package allows users to control the false discovery rate for
  online hypothesis testing, where hypotheses arrive sequentially in a stream,
  as presented by Javanmard and Montanari (2015, 2017). In this framework, a
  null hypothesis is rejected based only on the previous decisions, as the
  future p-values and the number of hypotheses to be tested are unknown.
